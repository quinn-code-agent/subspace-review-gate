# Multi-slice guard

`multi_slice_required` is true only when a Pilot or Production shape cannot
deliver its accepted journey as one integrated slice. POC does not use this
reference: recut the experiment to one runnable journey or ask for a different
profile.

## Rules

- Use at most two slices. If a piece can be blocked independently, it is another
  work item rather than a slice.
- Land and demo the first slice before finishing the second. Name the demo in
  advance.
- A slice must change observable behavior. Scaffolding is permitted only for a
  named sibling that will make it reachable.
- A walking skeleton may cross temporary ownership boundaries, but it records
  every fake, stub, hardcode, fixed value, and skipped validation in one shortcut
  inventory with the work item that removes each shortcut.

## Shape receipt

Record the result in the existing work item:

```yaml
journey_slices:
  demo: <first-slice observable journey>
  slices:
    - <slice one and its stop condition>
    - <optional slice two and its stop condition>
  shortcut_inventory:
    - shortcut: <temporary compromise>
      owner: <work item that removes it>
```

A body that declares more than two slices, unnamed scaffolding, or a walking
skeleton without a shortcut inventory fails shape before implementation.
